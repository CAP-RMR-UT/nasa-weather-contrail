CAP NASA Weather
----------------

This OpsPlan describes the joint mission of Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) weather and
contrail data collection.

NASA is collecting data to study the effects of contrail creation in the
upper troposphere on weather and climate. NASA has requested the aid of
CAP, with emphasis on CAP cadets, to conduct this data collection over all
states, districts, and territories. The data collection will happen over
multiple dates as specified in `Primary Dates & Times`_.

NASA will also be observing some units to see how we collect data, how we
run the mission, and the impacts of this activity on individuals interest
in STEM engagement. Wings and subordiante unit commanders will agree to this
observation.


Incident Command Post
---------------------

#. There shall be a National Unified Command to coordinate Region Unified
   Commands and any Wing Incident Command Posts that are not under a
   Region Unified Command.

#. Each region shall have a Region Unified Command to coordinate Wing
   Incident Commands for each wing in their region.

#. Each partipating wing may have a Wing Incident Command.

Mission Symbol
--------------

#. Mission symbol B99 "Other mission specifically assigned by the Air Force

   mission, but it doesn't appear to fit with any other mission symbl.

#. Mission symobl B11 "Flights flown under a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) and National Weather Service (NWS) mission number
   and flown IAW the NOAA and NWS MOU" may be used as this mission is
