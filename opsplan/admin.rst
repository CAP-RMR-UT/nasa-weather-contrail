Administration
==============


Inbound / Outbound Sorties
--------------------------

#. No flight sorties are expected.

#. No ground sorties are expected as each unit is expected to collect data
   at their normal meeting facilities.

#. Wing IC may approve ground sorties for a unit to travel to a different
   location to collect data.



Sortie Management
-----------------

#. Wing IC shall be the final approval for any ground sorties.

#. Wing IC, OSC, or GBD shall monitor ground sorties.



Safety Considerations
---------------------

#. The IC shall ensure all safety points are covered before release of
   any sortie.



Mission Paperwork
-----------------

#. Incident command system forms shall be stored electronically in the WMIRS
   mission files of the mission assigned to the incident command post in
   the "Plans" directory.

#. Event logging will be recorded in the WMIRS mission logging facility of
   the mission assigned to the incident command post. If the Activity Log
   (ICS 214) is used then it shall be stored electronically in the WMIRS
   mission files in the "Mission Logs" directory.

#. Raw data collection sheets shall be stored electronically in the WMIRS
   mission files for the wing mission the member signed into in the
   "Data" directory. The name of the file shall have the format
   "yyyy-mm-dd_unitid_capid_rawdata" where "yyyy" is the four digit year,
   "mm" is the two digit month, "dd" is the two digit day, "unitid" is the
   full unit id of the member that collected the data, the "capid" is the
   CAP ID number of the member that collected the data, and the "rawdata"
   indicates that this file contains raw data. For example, the following
   is a correct name for a JPEG file name:
   "2025-04-13_RMR-UT-191_140527_rawdata.jpeg".


Daily SITREPS
-------------

#. Each wing IC shall submit a SITREP at the end of the operational period
   to the region IC.

#. Each region IC shall submit a region SITREP at the end of the operational
   period to the national IC.
